# Calendar Reminder System

A web application for a clinic to automatically send appointment reminders to patients via WhatsApp, SMS, or Email, with response handling for rescheduling and cancellations.

## Features

- üìÖ Google Calendar integration for appointment management
- üì± WhatsApp Business API for messaging
- üìß Email notifications with SMTP
- üì≤ SMS fallback via Twilio
- üîÑ Automatic reminders 2 days before appointments
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è Patient response handling (reschedule/cancel)
- üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Staff notifications for appointment changes

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

3. **Configure API keys:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/setup`
   - Fill in all required API credentials:
     - Google Calendar API credentials
     - Twilio account details
     - WhatsApp Business API tokens
     - Email SMTP settings
     - Staff notification contacts

4. **Authenticate with Google:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/auth`
   - Complete OAuth flow to authorize calendar access

## Google Calendar Appointment Format

For the system to work properly, appointments in Google Calendar should include patient contact information in the description field:

```
Patient: John Doe
Phone: +1234567890
Email: john.doe@example.com
Doctor: dr.smith@clinic.com
```

The system will extract:
- `phone:` - Patient's phone number for WhatsApp/SMS
- `email:` - Patient's email address  
- `doctor:` - Doctor's email for cancellation notifications

## How It Works

1. **Scheduled Reminders**: Every hour, the system checks for appointments 2 days away
2. **Message Sending**: Tries WhatsApp first, then SMS, then email
3. **Response Handling**: Patients can reply "RESCHEDULE" or "CANCEL"
4. **Staff Notifications**: 
   - Reschedule requests notify the receptionist
   - Cancellations notify the assigned doctor
