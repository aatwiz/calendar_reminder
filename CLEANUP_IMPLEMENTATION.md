# Implementation Summary - Automatic Cleanup

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Added automatic cleanup of appointment link data to prevent storage buildup and maintain patient privacy.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Daily Cleanup**
- Runs every day at midnight (00:00)
- Timezone: Europe/Amsterdam
- Removes appointments where appointment time was >7 days ago
- Logs cleanup statistics to console

### 2. **Manual Cleanup Endpoint**
- Endpoint: `GET /cleanup-appointments`
- Returns JSON with statistics
- Can be triggered anytime for testing/immediate cleanup

### 3. **Smart Deletion Logic**
- Based on appointment time, not creation time
- Deletes both used and unused links
- 7-day retention period after appointment
- Preserves recent appointments

## 📁 Files Modified

### 1. `src/services/appointmentLinks.js`
**Added function:**
```javascript
cleanupOldAppointments()
```
- Calculates time since appointment
- Removes links older than 7 days
- Returns statistics (total, removed, remaining)
- Logs details of removed appointments

**Changes:**
- Added `cleanupOldAppointments` function (lines ~85-120)
- Exported new function in module.exports

### 2. `index.js`
**Changes:**
1. Import cleanup function (line ~21):
   ```javascript
   const { createAppointmentLink, cleanupOldAppointments } = require('./src/services/appointmentLinks');
   ```

2. Added manual cleanup endpoint (lines ~395-418):
   ```javascript
   app.get('/cleanup-appointments', ...)
   ```

3. Added automated cleanup cron job (lines ~511-535):
   ```javascript
   const cleanupCronJob = cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', ...)
   ```

4. Updated startup message (line ~544):
   ```
   🧹 Cleanup scheduled: Daily at midnight (removes appointments >7 days old)
   ```

## 📚 Documentation Created

### 1. `CLEANUP_FEATURE.md` (New)
Comprehensive documentation including:
- How cleanup works
- When it runs (automatic + manual)
- Configuration options
- Testing scenarios
- Monitoring commands
- Privacy considerations

### 2. Updated `INTERACTIVE_APPOINTMENTS.md`
- Added cleanup section
- Updated notes about data retention

### 3. Updated `QUICK_START.md`
- Added cleanup testing instructions
- Updated tips section

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Cleanup Logic
```javascript
const now = new Date();
const sevenDaysMs = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
const appointmentDate = new Date(appointment.appointmentTime);
const timeSinceAppointment = now - appointmentDate;

if (timeSinceAppointment > sevenDaysMs) {
  delete links[token]; // Remove
}
```

### Cron Schedule
```javascript
// Format: minute hour day month dayOfWeek
'0 0 * * *'  // Daily at 00:00 (midnight)
```

### Data Retention
- **7 days after appointment time**
- Example:
  - Appointment: October 5, 2025
  - Today: October 13, 2025 (8 days later)
  - Result: DELETED ✅

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Feature
```bash
# 1. Start server
node index.js

# 2. Trigger manual cleanup
curl http://localhost:3000/cleanup-appointments

# 3. Check response
{
  "success": true,
  "statistics": {
    "totalBefore": 0,
    "removed": 0,
    "remaining": 0
  },
  "removedAppointments": []
}
```

### Verify Server Logs
```
🚀 Server running at http://localhost:3000
⏰ Automated reminders scheduled: Every 15 minutes
🧹 Cleanup scheduled: Daily at midnight (removes appointments >7 days old)
```

## 🔐 Privacy & Compliance

### Benefits
1. **GDPR Compliance**: Data minimization principle
2. **Privacy Protection**: Limits retention of patient data
3. **Storage Efficiency**: Prevents unlimited growth
4. **Security**: Reduces attack surface

### What's Deleted
- ❌ Appointment link tokens (in appointment_links.json)
- ❌ Patient names and phone mappings
- ❌ Confirmation/cancellation records

### What's Preserved
- ✅ Calendar events (in Google Calendar)
- ✅ Event titles with emoji status (✅/❌/❓)
- ✅ All appointment history in calendar

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Change Retention Period
Edit `src/services/appointmentLinks.js`:
```javascript
const sevenDaysMs = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // Change to desired days
```

### Change Schedule
Edit `index.js`:
```javascript
// Current: Daily at midnight
cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', ...)

// Weekly: Every Sunday at 2 AM
cron.schedule('0 2 * * 0', ...)

// Twice daily: Every 12 hours
cron.schedule('0 */12 * * *', ...)
```

## 🚀 Production Recommendations

1. **Monitor Cleanup Logs**: Track how much data is being removed
2. **Adjust Retention**: Consider 14 or 30 days for audit purposes
3. **Backup Before Cleanup**: Optional - backup appointment_links.json daily
4. **Alert on Large Deletions**: Monitor if >100 appointments deleted at once
5. **Document Retention Policy**: Add to privacy policy

## 📈 Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable Retention**: Add to setup page UI
2. **Backup Old Data**: Archive before deletion
3. **Analytics**: Track confirmation/cancellation rates before deletion
4. **Granular Control**: Different retention for confirmed vs no-response
5. **Export Feature**: Download old appointments before cleanup
