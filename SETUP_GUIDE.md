This is the WhatsApp Business number you'll use to send messages:

2. You should see a phone number listed
3. Click on it to view details
4. Copy the **Phone Number ID** (looks like: `123456789012345`)

2. Select your business account
3. Go to **Accounts ‚Üí System Users**
4. Create a new System User (or use existing one)
5. Assign the System User access to your WhatsApp app
6. Generate a **Permanent Access Token** (‚ö†Ô∏è only shows once!)
7. Copy the token carefully

**Example**: `EAAVrDwi50qEBP9ex7T9ptr8qdIdXuDATxxbUxZCJ4nlRxQHw7hgyDM3dhWdOdVjNKM95oZB4IVqpE6POcphB7cbZB54IZBTw3jky2ZAmKjkcZAh1WXcuQB8noGhuyOGB9eaK4LMZCZCnfJic4Pob8JctYn29TlDTnWnoZBBp1R6gLCGTZAf0ZBMezwy78BAZBrgl0V93IQZDZD`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep this token safe** - don't share it with anyone!

## Step 4: Fill in the Setup Form

Now that you have all your credentials, go back to the clinic app:

1. Click **‚öôÔ∏è Setup** if you're not already there
2. Scroll down to **"WhatsApp Business API"** section

| **Business Account ID (WABA ID)** | From Step 5 above | `1307470840675023` |
| **Access Token** | From Step 6 above | `EAAVrDwi50qEBP9ex7T9ptr8qdIdXuDATxxbUxZCJ4nlRxQHw7hgyDM3dhWdOdVjNKM95oZB4IVqpE6POcphB7cbZB54IZBTw3jky2ZAmKjkcZAh1WXcuQB8noGhuyOGB9eaK4LMZCZCnfJic4Pob8JctYn29TlDTnWnoZBBp1R6gLCGTZAf0ZBMezwy78BAZBrgl0V93IQZDZD` |

| **Clinic Phone Number** | Your phone number | `+353871240142` |

4. Click **üíæ Save WhatsApp Credentials**
5. You should see **‚úÖ Setup Complete!**

## Step 5: Create Your Message Template

WhatsApp requires you to create and approve a message template before sending messages.

### Create Template in Meta:

1. Go to: **Meta Business Manager ‚Üí WhatsApp ‚Üí Message Templates**
2. Click **"Create Template"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Template Name**: `appointment_reminder`
   - **Category**: Select "Transactional"
   - **Language**: English

### Template Content:

In the message body, use these placeholders:

```
Hi {{1}},

Your appointment is coming up!

üìÖ Date & Time: {{2}}

Please confirm if you can make it or let us know if you need to reschedule.

Thank you,
[Your Clinic Name]
```

4. Click **Submit for Review**
5. Meta will review and approve within a few minutes

---

## Step 6: Test It Out

1. Create a test event in your Google Calendar
2. Format the title as: **`Patient Name #PhoneNumber`**
   - Example: `John Smith #+353871234567`
3. Set it for 24-48 hours in the future
4. The system will automatically send a WhatsApp reminder

---

## How It Works - Calendar Event Format

When creating calendar events, use this format:

```
Patient Name #PhoneNumber
```

**Examples:**
- `Sarah Murphy #0871234567` ‚Üí Will send to +353871234567
- `Mike Johnson #+353891234567` ‚Üí Will send to +353891234567

The system automatically:
- ‚úÖ Detects patient appointments from your calendar
- ‚úÖ Sends WhatsApp reminders 24-48 hours before
- ‚úÖ Tracks patient responses (Confirm/Reschedule)
- ‚úÖ Updates your calendar with emoji status:
  - `‚úÖ` = Confirmed
  - `üîÑ` = Marked for Rescheduling

---

## Patient Response Flow

When patients receive your reminder, they can reply:

1. **CONFIRM** ‚Üí Appointment confirmed, calendar gets ‚úÖ emoji
2. **RESCHEDULE** ‚Üí Clinic gets notified at +353871240142 to follow up

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Template not found" error
- Make sure Meta has approved your template
- Template name must match exactly (case-sensitive): `appointment_reminder`

### "Invalid phone number"
- Phone numbers must include country code
- Ireland: `+353` (remove leading 0)
- Example: `0871234567` ‚Üí `+353871234567`

### "Access Token expired"
- Generate a new permanent token from Meta
- Update it in the setup form

### Calendar events not sending reminders
- Make sure the event title has `#PhoneNumber`
- Check that the appointment is 24-48 hours away
- Verify WhatsApp is marked as **‚úÖ Configured** on setup page

---

## Security Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep your Access Token private** - never share it
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't commit credentials to GitHub (they're git-ignored)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Change your login password periodically: Settings ‚Üí Change Password
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only admins should have access to the setup page
